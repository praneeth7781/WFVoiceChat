                "question": "How do we calculate your variable APRs?",
                "answer": "Unless an introductory or promotional APR is in effect, we will add a 'Margin' to the U.S. Prime Rate to determine your standard variable APR. For each billing period we will use the U.S. Prime Rate, or the average of the U.S. Prime Rates if there is more than one, published in the Money Rates column of The Wall Street Journal three business days prior to your billing statement closing date. If the U.S. Prime Rate is not published or is otherwise unavailable, whether temporarily or permanently, we will select a substitute index that we believe, in our sole discretion, to be similar to the U.S. Prime Rate. The U.S. Prime Rate is 7.50 percentage points as of 01/08/2025. The 'Margin' for purchases and balance transfers will be 12.49 to 21.74 percentage points, based on your creditworthiness. The Maximum APR is 29.99%. The 'Margin' for cash advances will be 22.74 percentage points. The Maximum APR is 29.99%. Wells Fargo reserves the right to change terms, rates (APRs) and fees, at its discretion in accordance with the Consumer Credit Card Customer Agreement and Disclosure Statement ('Agreement') for your account and applicable law.You may not qualify for the lowest APRs disclosed above."

                "answer": "Cellular Telephone Protection can reimburse the eligible Choice Privileges Select Mastercard Credit Card cardholder for damage to, theft of, or involuntary and accidental parting of a cell phone. This is supplemental coverage not otherwise covered by another insurance policy (for example, cell phone insurance programs, or your homeowner’s, renter’s, automobile, or employer’s insurance policies) and may be applied after all other insurance is exhausted. Reimbursement is limited to the cost to repair or replace your original cell phone, less a $25 deductible with an allowable maximum of two paid claims per 12-month period. Each approved claim has a benefit limit of $800. This benefit does not cover cell phones that are lost (i.e., mysteriously disappear). This protection is only available when cell phone bills are paid with an eligible Choice Privileges Select Mastercard Credit Card. Eligible cell phones are the lines listed on your most recent cellular wireless service provider’s monthly billing statement for the billing cycle prior to when the incident occurred. Electronic failure or issues related to the software of the device are not covered. Cellular Telephone Protection coverage begins the first day of the calendar month following the payment of your first cell phone billing using your Choice Privileges Select Mastercard Credit Card, and remains in effect when you continue to charge your total monthly cell phone bill to your Choice Privileges Select Mastercard Credit Card. This protection may not be equivalent to or better than other applicable coverage. For complete coverage benefits and exclusions regarding this protection, refer to www.wellsfargo.com/choiceselectbenefits. Note: Call your cellular provider (or sign on to their website) and request to set up automatic payments. Setting up automatic payments is not required to qualify for Cellular Telephone Protection; however, you need to pay your monthly cell phone bill with your Choice Privileges Select Mastercard Credit Card to get up to $800 protection."
