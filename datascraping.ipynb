If your rent payment is less than $250, you will earn 250 points for that rent payment. Note, rent payments can only be made to one rental property per month.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Three points (1 base point plus 2 bonus points) are earned per $1 spent on qualifying net purchases at retailers whose merchant code for Mastercard is classified as Dining: eating places and restaurants, drinking places, bakeries, or fast food restaurants (caterers, grocery stores, and other miscellaneous places that serve food or operate restaurants on their premises are not considered eating places and restaurants).</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Two points (1 base point plus 1 bonus point) are earned per $1 spent on qualifying net purchases made directly at retailers whose Merchant code for Mastercard is classified as Travel: airlines, hotels, motels, resorts, cruise lines, and car rental agencies (bus lines, passenger railways/trains, taxicabs and limousines, rideshares, ferries, timeshares, travel agencies, online travel sites, real estate agents, vacation rental platforms (e.g. VRBO, Airbnb), campgrounds, boat lease/rental, motor home/recreational vehicle rental, toll bridges and highways, parking lots, and garages are not included).</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">One point will be earned per $1 spent on other qualifying net purchases.</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Except where otherwise provided, if you do not make at least 5 transactions in a statement period you'll earn a flat 250 points when you use your Bilt Mastercard to pay rent through the Bilt App or Bilt website, and you will not earn points on any other purchases.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Cardholders will earn 3 points (1 base point plus 2 bonus points) per dollar spent on net purchases (purchases minus returns/credits) on Lyft rideshares (Standard, Wait &amp; Save, Priority Pickup, Shared, Preferred, Lyft XL, Lux, Lux Black, and Lux Black XL), bikes, and scooters booked and completed through the Lyft app when using the Bilt Mastercard as the payment method. To earn the 3 points, Cardholders do not need to link their Bilt Rewards Program and Lyft accounts. This offer is not subject to the 5 transaction minimum requirement each statement period to earn 3 points, but the transaction(s) do count towards the 5 transaction minimum requirement for other earnings. To qualify for 3 points, the Bilt Mastercard account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. This offer excludes cancellation charges, damage charges, and round up and donate charges from Lyft. It may take up to seven (7) days after qualifying purchases for points to post to the Bilt Rewards Program account. If Bilt determines points were awarded towards an ineligible purchase, Bilt may revoke those points at any time at its discretion.<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle\"><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">When Cardholders link their Bilt Rewards Program account to the Lyft platform and set Bilt as the active loyalty partner, they will earn 2 points per dollar spent on net purchases on rideshare booked and completed through the Lyft app, excluding bike and scooter services. In order to link the Lyft platform and Bilt Rewards Program accounts, the phone number from the Lyft platform account must match the phone number on the Bilt Rewards account.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">When booking and completing a rideshare, Cardholders have the ability to combine these offers to earn up to 5 points through linking the Bilt Rewards Program and Lyft accounts and by using the Bilt Mastercard to pay for the ride.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">This offer is valid for continental US rides only, and excludes US territories.</li></ul></li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">The following will not count as qualifying net purchases and do not earn points:<table role=\"presentation\" style=\"border:2px solid black;border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:0pt;margin-top:3pt;width:1000\"><tbody><tr style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"><td scope=\"row\" style=\"border-right:2px solid black\"><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\"><strong>Cash Advances and Equivalents of Any Kind</strong></p></td><td style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\">ATM charges, cash advances, traveler’s checks, money orders, pre-paid gift cards, SUPERCHECKS™, wire transfers</p></td></tr><tr style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"><td scope=\"row\" style=\"border-right:2px solid black\"><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\"><strong>Balance Transfers</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\">Balance Transfers, SUPERCHECKS<sup>™</sup></p></td></tr><tr style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"><td scope=\"row\" style=\"border-right:2px solid black\"><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\"><strong>Disputes, Illegal Actions, and Violations</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\">Disputed or illegal purchases, purchases that violate the terms of your Credit Card Account Agreement or the Bilt Rewards Program Terms and Conditions</p></td></tr><tr style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"><td scope=\"row\" style=\"border-right:2px solid black\"><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\"><strong>Fees and Interest of Any Kind</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\">Fees or interest posted to your card account such as returned payment fees, late fees, monthly or annual fees</p></td></tr><tr style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"><td scope=\"row\" style=\"border-right:2px solid black\"><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\"><strong>Gambling Charges of Any Kind</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:3pt\">Bets or wagers transmitted over the internet, casino gaming chips, lottery tickets, off-track wagers</p></td></tr></tbody></table></li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Except where otherwise provided, points may show as pending until after the fifth transaction in each statement period.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Merchants are assigned codes by Mastercard based on the products or services they primarily sell. Purchases not processed using the codes for Mastercard identified above will not qualify for bonus points. Wells Fargo and Bilt do not have the ability to control how a retailer chooses to classify their business and, therefore, reserves the right to determine which purchases qualify for bonus points.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Merchants control when they process purchases; therefore the date each qualifying purchase posts to your account is determined solely based on the date provided by the merchant.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\"><p>You may not earn bonus points on:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:circle\"><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\"><p>Purchases made through third-party payment accounts, at online marketplaces, with retailers who submit purchases using a mobile or wireless card reader, or if you use a mobile or digital wallet.</p></li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\"><p>Tax Payments such as local, state, and federal entities that engage in financial administration and taxation, including the collection of taxes and penalties and the custody and disbursement of funds. Such merchants include property tax assessors’ offices, customs bureaus, and state tax commissions.</p></li></ul></li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Cardholders may not separate qualifying net purchases or rent payments into multiple transactions for the purpose of earning more points than would otherwise be available through a single transaction.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">If points are issued to you by Bilt for a qualifying net purchase or rent that is later returned or refunded, the rent payment or purchase is otherwise voided, the corresponding points will be automatically removed from your membership account even if they have already been redeemed.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Points will be considered earned when posted to your membership account, based on the qualifying net purchases made with your card account or rent paid with your card account through the Bilt App or Bilt website, plus any bonus points posted. If you have returns or refunds the associated points will be deducted from your total point balance, even if they have already been redeemed, and may result in a negative point balance.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">You may view your earned and unredeemed points on the Bilt App or Bilt website by logging into your membership account.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Bonus Offer Points:<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle\"><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Wells Fargo or Bilt may offer you ways to earn bonus points through the Card Rewards Program or with third-party partners, such as special promotional offers (\"promotional offers\" or \"bonus offers\"). You’ll find out more about the number of bonus points you can earn and any other terms at the time of the promotional offer. The additional terms for those promotional offers are incorporated by reference herein as part of this agreement.</li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\">Taking advantage of promotional offers is optional and such offers may be subject to any such third party’s additional terms and conditions that are outside of our control. Wells Fargo is not liable for the actions of those parties and their implementation of such additional terms and conditions. It is the cardholder’s responsibility to read carefully and comply with any terms and conditions imposed in connection with any promotional offer.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\"><p><strong>Points Redemption.</strong> You can redeem your points through the Bilt App or Bilt website. Points redemptions may not be refundable. Refer to the Bilt Rewards Program Terms and Conditions at www.biltrewards.com/terms for details.</p></li><li style=\"margin-top:3pt\"><p style=\"margin-top:3pt\"><strong>General Terms.</strong> We reserve the right to amend, cancel, or temporarily suspend the card Rewards Program, in whole or in part, or change any of the terms, at any time and for any reason, which may result in the decrease of redemption value or cancellation or forfeiture of any spend that has not been allocated to a point.
